Please note that,

I have removed google-services.com from my TestApplication for security purposes.Please add your 
Firebase provided google-services.json file to projects module app/ folder

Also Please replace your Facebook App id with facebook_app_id in strings.xml in values folder.

Please find the project related blog post from this link https://cnfitonline.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/authenticate-using-facebook-login-on-android-firebase/
